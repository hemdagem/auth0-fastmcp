# auth0-fastmcp

This project provides two FastMCP servers:
- `server.py`: Main API server
- `server_openapi.py`: OpenAPI documentation server

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.13 (recommended to use a virtual environment)
- pip

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/hemdagem/auth0-fastmcp.git
cd auth0-fastmcp
```

### 2. Create and Activate Virtual Environment
```bash
python3.13 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the Servers

### Run `server.py`
```bash
python server.py
```

- The API server will start. Default port and host are defined in the script (usually `localhost:8000`).
- Check the script for custom port or host settings.

### Run `server_openapi.py`
```bash
python server_openapi.py
```

- This will start the OpenAPI documentation server.
- Access the OpenAPI docs at the URL printed in the terminal (usually `http://localhost:8000/docs`).

## Environment Variables
If your app requires environment variables (e.g., Auth0 credentials), create a `.env` file in the project root. Example:
An example file named `.env.example` is provided in the project root. Copy it to `.env` and fill in your values:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```
Edit `.env` with your credentials and settings as needed.
Refer to `.env.example` and the code for required variables.

## Troubleshooting
- Ensure you are using Python 3.13 and the virtual environment is activated.
- If you encounter missing packages, re-run `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
- For port conflicts, change the port in the script or use environment variables if supported.

## Additional Notes
- For development, use the virtual environment to avoid dependency issues.
- For API usage, refer to the OpenAPI docs generated by `server_openapi.py`.
